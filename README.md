## Project Overview

This project presents a design-focused cloud architecture for a healthcare application that helps patients better understand their prescribed medications. The system allows patients or clinic staff to submit medication information, which is then organized by purpose and supplemented with explanations of common side effects. Clinicians can view summarized medication lists to support accurate medication reconciliation during clinical visits. The solution is designed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and emphasizes scalability, security, and cost efficiency.
